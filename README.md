This convertor is used to convert metadata from the doujins in this torrent (not mine) so that they can be 
easily added to pewpews HappyPanda doujin/manga database 

here is what you need to do in order to convert your files:

#step 1:
put the convertor in the root folder of the files (should contain only the 
folders that contain the individual chapters, use extract here when you extract the zips)
should have the folders saying what the parody is (bleach, gundam, etc) with each doujni inside

#step 2: 
run it on the command line
-type cd
-copy the directory of the program and paste after that, hit enter
-type py pururinConvertor.py and hit enter

#step 3: 
make a sandwich, it should take a while

#step 4: 
finally, add them to the database

this last step can take a very VERY VEEEERY long time if you do a large quantity.

and thats all!

if there are any issues, post them.
